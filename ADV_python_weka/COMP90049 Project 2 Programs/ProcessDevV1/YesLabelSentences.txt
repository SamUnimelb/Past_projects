whoa	quetiapine	stop	making	me	feel	drowsy	yo	
my	mood	swings	are	getting	worse	and	lamotrigine	isn	helping	at	all	
lamotrigine	also	causes	me	to	have	fewer	hours	sleep	night	
but	switched	to	trazodone	was	doing	some	crazy	ish	on	ambien	smh	not	good	lol	
all	the	time	took	trazodone	last	night	and	it	really	helped	but	it	was	difficult	to	wake	up	
ah	yes	starting	to	think	my	paroxetine	turns	panic	attacks	into	fat	
but	have	realised	that	it	the	lamotrigine	which	causes	the	joint	pain	
attempts	at	lamotrigine	withdrawal	commuting	by	train	every	day	and	being	back	at	work	in	new	role	
not	addictive	discontinuation	syndrome	know	someone	who	has	been	trying	to	come	off	venlafaxine	for	over	two	years	
take	olanzapine	and	have	permanent	dry	mouth	what	can	do	to	help	it
