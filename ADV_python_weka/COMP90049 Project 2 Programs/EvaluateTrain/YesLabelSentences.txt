think	my	tablets	have	made	me	gain	weight	anyone	on	fluoxetine	prozac	
thought	of	work	is	overwhelming	me	so	much	feel	like	crying	but	can	because	olanzapine	has	me	trapped	in	zombie	state	
clock	in	at	stone	stone	since	quetiapine	and	according	to	that	bmi	thing	obese	which	clearly	not	
but	don	want	to	take	an	ambien	or	trazodone	or	anything	because	dint	wanna	restart	my	dependence	upon	them	
had	sleep	paralysis	every	night	for	four	months	when	took	quetiapine	in	addition	to	lamotrigine	
my	battle	continues	with	olanzapine	weight	gain	with	bowl	of	porridge	and	bootcamp	
been	taking	low	dosage	of	paroxetine	for	the	last	two	years	and	only	recently	found	out	that	common	side	affect	is	pinsandneedles	
yeah	the	first	time	was	on	olanzapine	did	not	put	much	weight	on	but	time	did	weird	
after	taking	olanzapine	wake	up	and	feel	like	am	in	straight	jacket	because	my	muscles	feel	stiff	
omg	all	the	special	places	not	drunk	it	the	fluoxetine	
have	run	out	of	olanzapine	was	tapering	off	anyway	but	this	is	bit	too	quick	feel	restless	hot	bath	and	diazepam	time	
first	day	of	reduction	back	down	to	normal	dose	of	lamotrigine	before	could	literally	feel	it	irritating	my	nerve	endings	
ok	brain	body	we	need	chat	about	oversleeping	and	overeating	since	taking	olanzapine	again	
reducing	the	lamotrigine	is	grim	exhausted	and	grumpy	got	another	weeks	of	this	yet	wondering	if	doing	the	right	thing	
why	does	tapering	down	lamotrigine	feel	as	yucky	as	stepping	it	up	
anyone	taking	lamotrigine	suffer	with	headaches	weeks	after	starting	the	med	
actually	it	was	more	like	prison	but	with	nurses	instead	of	guards	olanzapine	pill	im	
coming	off	lamotrigine	has	been	as	bad	as	going	up	on	it	poorly	tummy	tiredness	feeling	disconnected	
only	one	day	in	and	mirtazapine	is	like	fluoxetine	all	over	again	it	just	makes	me	so	tiered	
same	with	venlafaxine	user	spoke	to	yrs	ago	stopped	taking	that	when	she	started	having	acid	like	trips	losing	hours	at	time	
despite	difficult	meeting	with	hr	today	feel	good	feel	chilled	feel	happy	but	still	feel	fat	
me	why	have	been	sectioned	what	psychotic	symptoms	do	have	psychiatrist	dancing	am	now	addicted	to	the	antipsychotic	olanzapine	
now	on	venlafaxine	my	main	issue	is	the	cataplexy	haha	just	ask	this	is	the	third	ve	tried	what	are	you	on	
olanzapine	is	amazing	srsly	the	dreams	are	immense	no	addiction	its	gorgeous	like	brave	new	world	soma	to	me	
only	problem	is	the	ride	has	fuelled	the	olanzapine	munchies	was	nightmare	in	the	supermarket	tonight	
nicotine	lozenges	if	go	cold	turkey	can	think	see	straight	so	can	work	
it	called	lamotrigine	pretty	sure	the	mix	of	them	both	is	making	me	sick	don	think	bipolar	add	mix	very	well	
gave	in	wholeheartedly	today	to	my	olanzapine	munchies	had	already	had	an	ice	cream	and	milkshake	before	this	pic	twitter	com	mrzznwzwrl	
the	only	things	know	allergic	to	are	sulfa	drugs	and	ciprofloxacin	
hubs	made	me	take	olanzapine	last	night	feel	rubbish	this	morning	really	down	think	relapsing	work	is	definitely	the	trigger	
probably	the	combination	with	my	fluoxetine	but	can	move	that	to	night	time	it	makes	me	have	bad	dreams	
for	anxiety	to	penetrate	through	my	drowsy	haze	result	of	the	triumvirate	of	fluoxetine	pregabalin	amoxicillin	is	pretty	good	going	
in	days	obvious	now	that	should	have	stopped	the	quetiapine	long	long	time	ago	before	got	in	this	state	
question	recently	have	been	hyper	sensitive	to	different	textures	does	anyone	know	if	this	is	bipolar	lamotrigine	thing	
extra	quetiapine	and	two	zopiclone	still	aren	helping	me	sleep	head	full	of	broken	biscuits	at	with	horrid	intrusive	thoughts	
had	great	few	hours	on	my	bike	but	exercise	drives	my	munchies	getting	fed	up	with	not	being	able	to	fit	into	summer	wardrobe	
note	to	self	nicotine	lozenge	alcohol	nausea	
wide	awake	and	this	trazodone	starting	to	feel	like	sugar	pill	actually	prefer	to	be	at	work	right	bout	now	
morning	fluoxetine	burp	makes	me	want	to	ralph	
each	brain	is	different	the	ssri	on	has	worked	really	well	prozac	made	me	zombie	
the	tabs	of	trazodone	my	gp	prescribed	are	too	much	now	that	don	take	them	every	night	still	zombieish	after	an	hour	awake	
keep	telling	myself	am	but	think	the	trazodone	fucks	it	up	it	knocks	me	right	out	and	won	let	me	wake	up	
does	the	tysabri	make	you	tired	at	first	after	infusion	not	that	you	need	an	excuse	to	be	tired	sleep	well	xx	xx	
you	have	any	medication	allergies	me	pt	wait	avelox	that	it	no	other	allergies	
fluox	friend	years	but	switch	to	cymbalta	anti	depress	pain	control	ocd	worry	can	stop	running	mind	
slept	hours	last	night	on	seroquel	
olanzapine	actually	makes	you	put	on	weight	even	when	you	aren	eating	that	much	
is	my	memory	really	bad	due	to	seroquel	and	cymbalta	or	the	bipolar	itself	not	remembering	conversations	
fluoxetine	and	quet	combo	zombified	me	ah	the	meds	merrygoround	
olanzapine	is	supposed	to	make	you	fat	bastard	got	off	lucky	lithium	makes	my	hand	shake	bipolar	or	schizo	drugs	
rather	be	on	the	effexor	that	made	me	happy	though	had	severe	back	pain	from	it	than	sad	and	crying	for	no	reason	on	lexapro	
ironically	the	pulmonologist	work	with	told	me	about	his	own	devastating	bout	with	after	cipro	
cipro	has	known	warning	of	weakening	the	achilles	tendon	
why	seroquel	can	make	me	put	on	over	kg	it	acts	like	an	insulin	blocker	or	something	
take	fluoxetine	and	quetiapine	the	quetiapine	is	the	one	with	the	massive	sleepies	althouth	the	flouxetine	doesn	help	
so	lasted	days	on	seroquel	couldn	handle	the	awful	side	effects	constantly	dizzy	and	lightheadeded	myriad	of	other	bad	stuff	
ugh	my	partner	was	on	paxil	for	while	it	made	him	hide	in	the	apartment	
thanks	yes	after	was	prescribed	cipro	few	years	ago	and	it	really	messed	me	up	am	quite	wary	of	broad	spectrum	ones	
pretty	lucid	in	all	my	dreams	and	the	seroquel	drowsiness	carried	over	into	the	dream	lolol	
ve	decided	really	not	happy	with	the	pain	lamotrigine	is	causing	or	the	poor	sleep	am	thinking	of	asking	for	trial	of	prozac	and	
does	anyone	know	if	the	gain	is	less	in	combined	with	than	in	olanzapine	alone	
the	misery	experiencing	today	from	the	pain	outweighs	the	anti	depressant	effect	of	the	lamotrigine	
can	only	get	about	hours	of	sleep	on	my	own	but	got	at	least	hours	with	seroquel	now	see	how	people	can	get	addicted	
feel	siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick	damn	you	venlafaxine	
not	to	mention	the	thousands	of	people	online	who	say	they	ve	stacked	on	the	weight	due	to	taking	seroquel	
sure	wish	my	doctor	had	told	me	cipro	could	disable	me	for	life	there	was	never	any	mention	of	that	now	crippled	
it	ok	guess	it	just	case	of	trial	and	error	with	antidepressants	coming	off	venlafaxine	has	been	so	nasty	
my	sim	card	isn	working	aaggh	feel	like	im	having	cymbalta	withdrawal	again	aaagh	aaaggh	
why	do	always	get	the	seroquel	munchies	
depression	hurts	cymbalta	can	fuck	your	whole	body	up	inside	out	so	your	rainy	day	doesn	seem	so	bad	pussy	
thanks	am	so	chuffed	got	so	big	on	olanzapine	been	working	hard	for	it	
when	was	on	cymbalta	and	visanne	could	not	orgasm	at	all	
boniva	would	ve	been	better	properly	named	as	an	erectile	dysfunction	drug	
coming	off	the	lamotrigine	it	not	acceptable	to	be	in	pain	most	of	the	time	struggled	to	get	out	of	the	bath	on	sat	
the	drugs	don	work	from	fit	to	hobbling	in	few	days	off	the	pills	but	may	need	wks	to	recover	be	prone	to	ruptures	
has	beta	blockers	now	apparently	the	fluoxetine	can	cause	panic	attacks	
really	takes	it	out	on	me	spent	most	of	the	day	sleeping	
vyvanse	and	seroquel	
the	pathway	of	cipro	is	definitely	murdering	my	mind	right	now	
try	to	take	seroquel	and	alcohol	all	at	the	same	time	and	your	world	will	be	like	aersdd	gjluvzcf	arfrcgjklkjf	yup	
it	wasn	an	easy	victory	though	felt	like	chemo	with	the	cipro	as	for	the	heart	meant	for	study	purposes	
appreciate	it	gained	over	with	paxil	so	trying	something	different	tired	of	the	appetite	side	effects	
this	new	baccy	is	just	making	my	cough	so	much	worse	but	ahhh	well	need	my	nicotine	
guess	the	doctor	was	right	when	he	said	don	eat	any	dairy	products	within	hours	of	taking	this	levofloxacin	times	
nicotine	withdrawals	
do	you	know	how	badly	want	cigarette	right	now	but	no	manfully	suffer	through	nicotine	withdrawal	all	for	you	
void	of	nicotine	and	my	moods	are	void	of	stability	
count	kum	hai	can	avoid	it	being	nicotine	addict	
need	more	medication	than	this	my	body	is	already	building	tolerance	for	the	prozac	ve	been	taking	
hate	to	hear	that	taking	seroquel	is	like	swallowing	sleeping	pill	when	wake	up	then	trying	to	function	normally	
took	percocet	for	my	tooth	feel	like	about	to	die	cause	of	the	prozac	thats	already	in	my	system	apparently	you	can	take	both	fml	
did	you	get	floxed	too	ve	been	in	bed	since	thanks	to	just	cipro	pills	they	never	told	me	this	can	be	permanent	
cipro	is	real	bad	on	your	entire	body	take	it	from	me	disability	since	thanks	to	just	pills	
day	five	of	no	effexor	am	guessing	this	is	what	it	feels	like	when	you	come	off	heroin	
blargh	hate	this	particularly	with	seroquel	at	night	not	don	sleep	if	have	and	have	more	cant	get	up	
plus	this	antibiotic	is	making	me	stupid	and	clumsy	cipro	is	evil	but	the	fever	is	gone	
oh	it	sucks	but	try	doing	snri	withdrawal	they	had	to	put	me	on	whole	other	drug	just	to	get	me	off	effexor	
so	may	be	allergic	to	the	metoprolol	rash	on	my	face	needing	my	inhaler	daily	since	friday	
ve	been	so	tired	since	started	the	cymbalta	sleep	so	much	case	in	point	just	slept	an	hour	before	bed

effexor	withdrawal	
not	sure	what	antibiotic	that	was	in	the	pic	bactrim	but	dairy	products	reduce	the	efficacy	of	ciprofloxacin

if	this	is	real	question	withdrawal	from	an	antidepressant	named	effexor	was	worse	than	cocaine	withdrawal	
thinking	it	might	be	the	baclofen	doing	it	only	on	low	dose	though	broken	sleep	is	nightmare	msfatigue	
at	the	end	of	most	working	days	still	have	to	nap	loads	just	to	get	through	week	some	days	better	than	others	
resent	taking	olanzapine	as	it	is	the	side	effects	of	olanzapine	that	were	mistaken	for	negative	symptoms	of	schizophrenia	
im	on	cypro	actually	in	dying	on	cypro	
this	seroquel	is	hitting	me	soo	hard	with	this	beer	
hot	flashes	won	be	around	forever	but	weaning	of	paroxetine	could	be	nightmare	
oh	hey	much	like	other	anti	convulsants	lamictal	dehydrates	you	so	much	is	explained	
am	on	quetiapine	mainly	tiredness	it	causes	with	me	
personal	frustration	med	that	work	then	wear	off	even	when	taking	mtx	for	anti	bodies	
ah	the	sting	of	the	injection	how	ve	not	missed	thee	
he	said	he	is	dying	of	starvation	don	want	to	be	the	one	to	say	stop	taking	the	aricept	and	namenda	
quetiapine	perhaps	gives	most	dramatic	effect	for	single	low	dose	no	pts	are	not	being	lazy	in	bed	hours	day	asleep	
so	ran	out	of	victoza	before	payday	restarted	it	yesterday	bleh	nausea	it	did	help	me	lose	lbs	but	found	when	ran	out	
ve	taken	the	bp	daily	if	not	twice	day	like	should	it	juz	didn	think	the	effexor	would	spike	it	so	usually	
haven	had	an	orgasm	in	long	time	wtf	
helped	my	but	then	issues	ensued	now	can	take	anything	have	major	lung	issues	
don	want	to	take	my	humira	at	all	the	pain	is	always	unbearable	and	don	wanna	
suggest	never	stop	taking	effexor	abruptly	because	you	will	feel	like	you	re	on	your	death	bed	
no	pain	is	worse	than	humira	not	even	arthritis	lmfao	
one	of	the	things	hate	most	about	quetiapine	is	when	take	it	for	the	first	few	hours	slur	my	words	so	people	assume	merely	drunk	
when	had	my	infected	stone	hospital	put	me	on	cipro	synthetic	antibiotic	pungent	solvent	odor	smell	it	now	why	
start	on	tues	of	so	know	it	helped	but	it	then	destroyed	my	lungs	
zoloft	was	just	as	bad	as	effexor	it	made	me	more	depressed	and	more	suicidal	don	want	it	
my	cell	went	up	ith	humira	also	have	crohns	disease	wish	guys	had	more	articles	with	people	like	me	in	it	
fucking	effexor	withdrawals	would	shake	my	fist	but	don	have	the	energy	
still	slightly	fast	pulse	this	morning	know	this	is	the	quetiapine

watch	your	eyesight	with	lamictal	went	from	awesome	vision	to	wearing	glasses	full	time	for	the	yrs	was	on	it	
have	am	taking	lamotrigine	and	wondered	if	anyone	else	has	had	insomnia	as	side	effect	and	what	to	do	about	it	
what	to	do	not	looking	forward	to	cold	turkey	withdrawals	from	pristiq	sense	of	impending	doom	anxiety	only	makes	the	situation	worse	
brisdelle	dangerous	paxil	is	supposed	to	treat	depression	and	suicidal	thoughts	took	paxil	and	got	depressed	went	off	ok	in	wk	
half	awake	and	po	of	baclofen	and	of	valium	legs	still	spasmed	too	much	to	get	tatted	hatechyu	legs	
what	nightmare	made	me	jump	awake	not	nice	at	all	thought	was	supposed	to	keep	me	asleep	through	the	night	
my	choice	was	more	on	small	bowel	or	like	now	is	my	only	hope	treat	side	effect	
the	placebo	week	of	birth	control	increases	blood	levels	of	lamictal	which	in	turn	makes	me	very	cheerful	insomniac	
in	need	of	dream	interpreter	is	really	having	an	affect	on	my	night	visions	some	fucked	up	scenarios	in	my	sleep	lol	
just	had	marathon	sleep	past	on	new	dose	of	my	liver	will	be	ok	on	it	woke	with	stressy	tummy	pains	
would	like	to	know	what	everyone	else	experience	are	of	baclofen	and	clonazepam	do	they	get	dry	nose	throat	
used	to	be	on	them	was	the	psychotic	episode	when	starting	but	one	of	my	favs

anyone	on	cymbalta	it	is	making	me	like	zombie	and	still	hating	the	world	
ve	had	too	much	quetiapine	today	zombified	
have	been	on	lorazepam	diazepam	quetiapine	for	the	past	few	nights	and	ve	noticed	am	slightly	drooling	bit	lovely	
all	have	to	say	is	cipro	will	mess	you	up	kids	don	get	sick	
well	my	effexor	kinda	did	its	job	to	keep	my	anxiety	under	control	but	now	to	get	my	heart	rate	down	ugh

whilst	most	kids	ask	santa	for	xmas	presents	like	can	we	reduce	my	quetiapine	intake	need	to	get	out	of	bed	
sweaty	fluoxetine	addict	
right	some	ssris	are	used	for	cataplexy	as	is	effexor	can	be	tricky	to	wean	off	without	rebound	
crippled	since	oct	of	thanks	to	just	cipro	pills	here	run	for	your	life	tendon	rupture	is	only	the	tip	of	the	iceberg	
neither	of	you	appear	to	be	aware	that	cipro	can	cripple	otherwise	healthy	people	doctor	fail	to	mention	that	
had	my	doctor	attempted	to	treat	with	bactrim	prior	to	cipro	wouldn	be	crippled	today	
quetiapine	side	affects	are	increased	appetite	and	cravings	it	all	makes	sense	
oh	and	forgot	that	with	lamotrigine	come	awful	night	terrors	woke	up	no	fewer	than	five	times	screaming	and	sweaty	
the	only	medication	which	am	aware	and	know	almost	all	of	them	that	has	regular	headache	side	effect	is	lamictal	
since	quetiapine	messed	with	my	prolactin	levels	making	my	boobs	humungous	my	bras	so	expensive	want	lingerie	component	to	dla
