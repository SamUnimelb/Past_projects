# Greaton_Invest_Website
This is the intended Greaton Invest website required by Mr. Phanton. 

The current website uses "Home-Greaton_Invest.html" as the main website.

Hyperlinks inside this file will be linked to corresponding websites in the folder sub_sites.

All the webpages are stylized using "web_style.css" file.

All the sources used to make the websites are in the subfolder "src".

The company Greaton Invest's parent website, namely Greaton website, was downloaded in 
"sample_parent_comp" as the example to learn and to design from.

# Changes of version 0.1
Added changes to hyperlinks as requested by Mr. Phanton. Now if you click the links, the fonts
will be grey. 
This version fixed some bugs in the sub_sites "company_intro.html" as well, by simply replacing
images that do not work properly under CSS sheets.
